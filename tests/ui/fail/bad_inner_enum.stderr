error[E0599]: the method `ctor_tokens` exists for enum `TestEnum<BadInner>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied
  --> tests/ui/fail/bad_inner_enum.rs:17:9
   |
4  | struct BadInner {}
   | --------------- doesn't satisfy `BadInner: Quine`
...
7  | enum TestEnum<T> {
   | ---------------- method `ctor_tokens` not found for this enum because it doesn't satisfy `TestEnum<BadInner>: Quine`
...
17 |     bad.ctor_tokens();
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `TestEnum<BadInner>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: trait bound `BadInner: Quine` was not satisfied
note: the trait `Quine` must be implemented
  --> src/quine.rs
   |
   | pub trait Quine {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `ctor_tokens`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Quine`
